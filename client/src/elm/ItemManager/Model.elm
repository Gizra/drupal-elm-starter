{-| We track any Items we are currently subscribed to.

In theory, we'll only typically have one at a time. However, the logic of
subscribing and unsubscribing will be required in any event. Thus, it's
simpler to just track whatever we're subscribed to. That is, we could limit
ourselves to one subscription at a time, but that would actually be extra
logic, not less.

Each `Pages.Item.Model.Model` is wrapped in a `WebData`, because we
derive it from fetching a `Item` through `WebData` ... it's simplest to
just stay within the `WebData` container.

{-| Our messages:

* `Subscribe` means "fetch the Item and listen to its pusher events"

* `Unsubscribe` means "forget the Item and stop listening to its pusher events"
